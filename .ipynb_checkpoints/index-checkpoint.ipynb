    "*Theory*:  But your knowledge of data science should not end with this course.  The field of data science will continue to evolve, and you'll need to understand the reasoning and shifts in the future.  For that, we need you to reach to the reasoning behind the techniques, and yes that includes the underlying mathematics. \n",

Still, we won't shy away from it.  Chances are you learned math through pencil and paper, not through programming graphs and equations that automatically respond to your inputs.  It's time to give it a honest try.\n",

So that's why we make sure to show you the power of each new skill you are learning, and the rich ideas underneath each new concept.  And it's why we have you code on our Learn platform that allows you to tap into the broader community of learners."
